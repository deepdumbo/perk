This is the project directory for code and data related to the paper: 

Gopal Nataraj, Jon-Fredrik Nielsen, and Jeffrey Fessler  
Dictionary-Free MRI PERK: Parameter Estimation via Regression with Kernels  
To appear in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging  
[http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2018.2817547]  

## Getting Started

1. Install the Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox, available for free download [here](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/).

2. Replicate the paper's results by following directions within subdirectories of `./exp`. 

3. For implementations of PERK and other tested algorithms, go to `./map/t1-t2`.

4. For PERK intuition, check out the toy problems within `./toy/`.
