# Getting Started

1. Modify line 15 in main.m to point to your local irt path.
2. Run main.m, which should execute quickly. PERK results should be the same as in the paper, but VPM and PGPM results are poorer because coarse grid search and zero iterations are used by default. 
3. To replicate paper results, comment out lines 153, 156, 169 and uncomment lines 154, 157, 170.
